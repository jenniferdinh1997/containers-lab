# Exercise 1:
# Create a list named students containing some student names (strings).
# Print out the second student's name.
# Print out the last student's name.

students = ['Bob', 'John', 'Bill']
print(students[1])
print(students[-1])

# Exercise 2:
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Use a for loop to print out the string "food goes here is a good food".
food = ('cheese', 'macaroni', 'bacon')
for food in food:
    print(f'{food} is a good food')
